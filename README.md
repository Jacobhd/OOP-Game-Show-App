# OOP-Game-Show-App

Browser-based letter guessing Star Trek inspired Game Show App using multiple files.

When a game starts a random phrase is hidden on screen. As the user guesses letters, buttons are disabled and parts of the phrase appear or lives are lost leading to a game over.

Features JavaScript class methods, constructor method properties, an array of objects, global event listeners, user keyboard interaction, updated CSS classes, and cross file programming.

Gold lettering throughout and gold added to Start Game button. Turns into a navy background game screen with a gold header, also carries over navy with gold on a win condition. Onscreen keyboard letters have a grassy green color (matched) or greyed out (wrong), while the shown letters in the phrase have a visible lighter navy blue slightly darker than the hearts/life images.

Updated CSS classes include: --color-win: #001f3f; --color-lose: #3a3f58;
body { background: #001f3f; } h1 { color: gold; } #btn__reset { background-color: gold; } .header { color: gold; } .show { background-color: #004E7C; }
.title { color: gold; }
